Functions like **`print()`** and **`type()`** are universal and can be used on all of the data types we've seen so far. But some functions are specific to certain data types. **`split()`** breaks up strings into substrings. But we can't break up the number **`3`** or the boolean **`TRUE`**... what would the components be? Functions that only work on one type of data are used in a slightly different way: they are written *after* the variable being modified.
