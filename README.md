# HER CODE CAMP Summer Series 2020
The Summer Series consists of 6 code-along-with-us videos explaining introductory python concepts that cumulate in coding a game of Rock-Paper-Scissors!

In this repository you will find copy of the ipython notebooks used for each video, links to the videos, and a video explaining how to upload and use the notebooks in Google Colab.
